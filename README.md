For the doorsplits, download <a id="raw-url" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mysterion06/DMC3Splitter/master/doorsplits.lss">doorsplits.lss</a>, and open it with Livesplit. Then in the Livesplit "Edit Layout" section, remove the "Splits" plugin by highlighting it and pressing the <kbd>-</kbd> icon, then add the "Subsplits" plugin by clicking the <kbd>+</kbd> icon > List > Subsplits. All 195 splits are prenamed.

For the kill counter, you need to download [ASLVarViewer](https://github.com/hawkerm/LiveSplit.ASLVarViewer/releases) and add the .dll file to the livesplit components folder. Then add it to the layout from livesplit's layout settings, and in the ASLVarViewer settings, select killCounter from the variables.

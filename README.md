[Click here to download the autosplitter and some pre-generated door/chapter splits](https://github.com/Mysterion06/DMC3Splitter/releases/download/v1.0/dmc3autosplitter.zip)

Make sure to select the correct settings under the livesplit edit layout section in the "Scriptable autosplitter" settings.

For configuring the doorsplits as subsplits, download the above "doorsplits-subsplits.lss" file, and open it with Livesplit. Then in the Livesplit "Edit Layout" section, remove the "Splits" plugin by highlighting it and pressing the <kbd>-</kbd> icon, then add the "Subsplits" plugin by clicking the <kbd>+</kbd> icon > List > Subsplits. All 195 splits are prenamed.

For the kill counter, you need to download [ASLVarViewer](https://github.com/hawkerm/LiveSplit.ASLVarViewer/releases) and add the .dll file to the livesplit components folder. Then add it to the layout from livesplit's layout settings, and in the ASLVarViewer settings, select killCounter from the variables.
